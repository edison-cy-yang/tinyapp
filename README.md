# TinyApp Project

TinyApp is a full stack web application built with Node and Express that allows users to shorten long URLs (Ã  la bit.ly).

Analytics is implemented for each shortened URL. Users that own the URL can see the total hits, total number of unique visitors, and visit history for the shortened URL.
